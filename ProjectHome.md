# MathTextRecognizer2 Project Home Page #

This project is being developed as the final year project of Luis Román Gutiérrez, student at the University of Seville, Spain.

Its aim is to create an OCR system useful to get scientific texts in image format, including formulas, and transform them in laTeX or MathML source code.

The project consists in a program used to learn about the simbols which will be recognized, and other program which uses the databases created by the previous one to perform the actual recognition of the formulas, keeping their mathematical meaning.

The plataform the project is being developed on is Mono, and the programing language C#.

You can get more info in the project's [WikiHome](WikiHome.md).
